This project simulates a customer behaviour in a supermarket based on Markov Chain. The project has been developed in collaboration with 
<a href="https://github.com/ai-aksoyoglu">@ai-aksoyoglu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AlphanAksoyoglu">@AlphanAksoyoglu</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pavrmk">@pavrmk</a> and involves the following steps:

### 1. Exploring the data (includes pandas wrangling)
### 2. Calculating transition probabilities (a 5x5 matrix)

### 3. Creating a customer class and implementing MCMC for one customer
### 4. Creating a supermarket class that simulates multiple customers
### 5. Filling the shelves of a supermarket image and visualizing the supermarket
